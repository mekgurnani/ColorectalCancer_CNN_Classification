# Exploring Transfer Learning and Ensemble Stacking for Multi-Class Tissue Classification in Colorectal Cancer Images

### Rationale - 
- Colorectal Cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer (1) and the most common cause of death due to cancer
- But is also the second most preventable cancer, if detected early (2)
- Traditionally, manual feature extraction methods have been used to capture properties of the internal structure of image regions combined with classical machine learning (ML)
- Using deep learning methods such as convolution neural networks (CNNs) can performa

  
This project takes on the task of **multi-class classification** to classify 8 different tissue types of human colorectal cancer - 
  1. Tumour epithelium
  2. Simple Stroma
  3. Complex stroma (contains single tumour cells and/or few immune cells)
  4. Immune cells clusters (referred as lympho)
  5. Cell debris
  6. Normal mucosal glands
  7. Adipose tissue
  8. Background (no tissue - empty)
